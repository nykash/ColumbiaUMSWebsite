    "abstract": "A complex torus is a 2n-dimensional torus (S^1)^2n equipped with an appropriate complex structure. An abelian variety is a special type of complex torus, and it has been an important object since its introduction to algebraic geometry. In this talk, we define these objects more properly and study how they degenerate into a possibly \"singular\" object in algebraic geometry."

    "title": "Moduli Spaces and Stacks",
    "abstract": "In algebraic geometry, a key method for studying families of objects is to find a space that parameterizes them in a geometrically meaningful way. We will explore this fundamental concept of a \"moduli space\" using simple examples from elementary geometry, also mentioning interesting problems that can be solved with such techniques. Then we will see some technical challenges that arise and give intuition for how the abstract notion of \"stacks\" can address them."

    "title": "Representation theory of symmetric groups versus symmetric functions",
    "abstract": "It is a well-known fact that the Grothendieck ring of complex modules over symmetric groups is isomorphic to the ring of symmetric functions; in this talk we will begin by sketching a proof of this fact. Then I will point out the Jacobi-Trudi phenomenon, and introduce the degenerate affine Hecke algebra of rank 1 to realize this as a non-semisimple phenomenon. I will assume some basic familiarity with the representation theory of finite groups."

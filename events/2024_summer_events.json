    "title": "Review of Linear Algebra and Group Theory",
    "abstract": "We review key definitions and results in linear algebra and group theory that will be relevant when studying representation theory, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the definition of a module, normal subgroups and quotient groups, and the first isomorphism theorem. If time permits, we will also give a precise definition of a representation of a group, and an example."

    "title": "FG-Modules, Irreducibility, and Regular Representations",
    "abstract": "After learning about FG modules last week, we want to explore their structure more in depth. This week we will discuss the idea of reducibility, along with specific useful modules such as the permutation modules. Finally we will tie these all together and discuss the group algebra, which gives way to the regular representation."

    "title": "Zachary Lihn",
    "abstract": "We'll continue our study of FG-modules by quickly defining FG-module homomorphisms and their basic properties. We'll then discuss the important result known as Maschke's Theorem, which reduces our study of FG-modules to the irreducible ones. Finally, we'll prove Schur's Lemma, which (time permitting) will allow us to classify the representations of finite abelian groups over the complex numbers."

    "abstract": "We introduce and prove fundamental facts about characters and their orthogonality for groups, highlighting the general story on Lie groups. We also introduce Weyl's unitary trick in addition to giving connections of representation theory to general relativity and quantum mechanics. TBD"
